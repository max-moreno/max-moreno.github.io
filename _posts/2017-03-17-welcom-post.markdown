Hello, you are now on the blog of Max Moreno. A little bit about myself: I am currently a senior in high school with a pretty big interest in computer science. Thus, most, if not all, will be related to any personal projects I am working on or other computer science related topics. Since the majority of things I learn are from the Internet they might not be well written. But I will try my best to help other beginners in how to get started programming, and other CS topics. I am also welcome to any other suggestions which can be made by contacting me through social media, or email. I am excited to get this blog running!
